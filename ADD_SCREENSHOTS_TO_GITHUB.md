# 📸 Add Screenshots to GitHub - EXACT STEPS

**Your README is now fixed! Just add the image files.**

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Screenshots

Take screenshots of your app and save them with these **EXACT names**:

1. `app-dashboard-light.png` - Dashboard (light theme)
2. `app-dashboard-dark.png` - Dashboard (dark theme)
3. `app-add-todo-light.png` - Add Todo page
4. `app-view-tasks-light.png` - View Tasks page
5. `app-analytics-light.png` - Analytics dashboard
6. `app-team-chat-light.png` - Team Chat page

**Important:** 
- File names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Files must be `.png` format
- Save them on your computer first

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub (EASIEST METHOD)

1. **Open:** https://github.com/tnikhilchowdary/fullstack-project-using-AI

2. **Click** on the `screenshots/` folder

3. **Click** "Add file" button (top right)

4. **Click** "Upload files"

5. **Drag and drop** all 6 `.png` files OR click "choose your files" and select them

6. **Scroll down** and click **"Commit changes"** (green button)

7. ✅ **Done!** Wait 10 seconds, then refresh your README page

### Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your README: https://github.com/tnikhilchowdary/fullstack-project-using-AI
2. Scroll to "Application Screenshots" section
3. **Images should now display!** 🎉

## 🎯 What Changed

I've updated your README to use HTML `<img>` tags instead of markdown syntax. This works better on GitHub:

**Before:**
```markdown
![Dashboard Light Theme](screenshots/app-dashboard-light.png)
```

**After:**
```html
<img src="screenshots/app-dashboard-light.png" alt="Dashboard Light Theme" width="800"/>
```

## ⚠️ If Images Still Don't Show

1. **Check file names** - Must match exactly
2. **Check file location** - Must be in `screenshots/` folder
3. **Refresh page** - GitHub may need a moment to update
4. **Check file size** - GitHub supports files up to 100MB
